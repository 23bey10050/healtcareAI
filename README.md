Project Overview
The Healthcare Assistant Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that provides basic healthcare-related advice based on user queries. It leverages Hugging Face's RoBERTa model for question-answering and applies NLTK for text preprocessing. The chatbot can respond to common health-related queries like sneezing, symptoms, appointments, and medication.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses the deepset/roberta-base-squad2 model for understanding healthcare queries.
Preprocessing with NLTK: Removes stopwords and tokenizes user input for better response accuracy.
Healthcare-Specific Responses: Provides predefined responses for common healthcare topics.
Interactive Web Interface: Built using Streamlit for a simple and user-friendly chatbot experience.
